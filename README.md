# hotspots

- high-level technical architecture
	- A logical controller and cell-based system where each cell has these properties
		- Cell
		  collapsed:: true
			- Coordinate
			- Windspeed
			- Wind direction
			- Terrain
			- Resources
				- Personnel
				- Aircrafts
				- Vehicles
			- Fuel
				- Class
				- Percent
			- Fires
				- Probability
				- Size
				- Severity?
		- Controller
	- SourceDB - Simulated cell state management + updating based on rules
		- Rules:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Wind
	- WildfireMonitor - polls sourceDB  to detect existing and potential fires. Emits a detection event
		- Detection
		  collapsed:: true
			- Cell
			- Fires
				- Probability
				- Size
				- Severity (for the individual fire)
			- Detection Severity
			- Status
				- Active
				- Predicted
				- Mitigated
	- DetectionMonitor - reads active and predicted detections and outputs a Plan object
		- MitigationPlan (array of actions)
			- ordered? (bool)
			- Action (arr)
				- Cell
				- Type
					- (deploy_drone)
					- (deploy_man)
					- (evacuate_cell)
					- (none_needed)
	- PlanHandler - inputs a plan and performs the actions
		- type-action mappings:
			- deploy_drone
			- deploy_man
				- add X man to resource
			- evacuate_cell
				- reduce cell personell resources to zero (not instantly, over a time proportional to the amount of people present)
			- none_needed
				- do nothing, respond cell mitigated to Parent
